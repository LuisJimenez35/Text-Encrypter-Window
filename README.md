# 💻📋 Text-Encrypter-Window
## 💬Introduction:
This small project is the first Challenge of the Group 5 Oracle One Next Education study program.

It is a small text encryptor that changes letters to monosyllables to semi-encrypt written text.
## 📑Description
During these four weeks, we are going to work on an application that encrypts texts, so that you can exchange secret messages with other people who know the secret of the encryption used.

The encryption "keys" we will use are as follows:

The letter "e" is converted to "enter".
The letter "i" is converted to "imes".
The letter "a" is converted to "ai".
The letter "o" is converted to "ober".
The letter "u" is converted to "ufat".
