# 💻📋 Text-Encrypter-Window
## 💬Introduction:
This small project is the first Challenge of the Group 5 Oracle One Next Education study program.

It is a small text encryptor that changes letters to monosyllables to semi-encrypt written text.
## 📑Description
During these four weeks, we are going to work on an application that encrypts texts, so that you can exchange secret messages with other people who know the secret of the encryption used.

The encryption "keys" we will use are as follows:

The letter "e" is converted to "enter".
The letter "i" is converted to "imes".
The letter "a" is converted to "ai".
The letter "o" is converted to "ober".
The letter "u" is converted to "ufat".
## 📝Requirements for the encryption project
- Must work only with lowercase letters
- No letters with accents or special characters should be used.
- It must be possible to convert a word for the encrypted version also return an encrypted word for its original version.
  - For example:
    "gato" => "gaitober".
    gaitober" => "gato".

- The page must have fields for inserting the text to be encrypted or decrypted, and the user must be able to choose between the two options.
- The result should be displayed on the screen.
- A button to copy the encrypted/decrypted text to the transfer section, i.e. with the same functionality as ctrl+C or the "copy" option in the applications menu
